Feature: Playing Dots and Boxes
  * game begins with empty grid of dots
  * players take turns at adding a horizontal or vertical line
    between two un-joined adjacent dots.
  * a player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box earns a point,
    writes their initials in the box and gets another turn.
  * game is over when there are no more lines that can be placed
  * winner is the player with most boxes
  * the board can be of any size 2x2, 5x5 works well for experts
  * a grid of 1x2 with boxes would look like:

 {0,0} {0,1} {0,2}
     +---+---+
     | 1 | 2 |
     +---+---+
 {1,0} {1,1} {1,2}


  * a 2x2 grid with boxes would look like:

  {0,0} {0,1} {0,2}
      +---+---+
      | 1 | 2 |
 {1,0}+---+---+{1,2}
      | 3 | 4 |
      +---+---+
  {2,0} {2,1} {2,2}

  @todo
  Scenario: Player joins two dots on the grid
    Given a grid of size 1x2 with players "foo, bar"
            |  +   +   +  |
            |             |
            |  +   +   +  |

    When a player "foo" joins dots {1,1} and {1,0}
    Then the grid looks like:
            |  +   +   +  |
            |      Â¦      |
            |  +   +   +  |

  @todo
  Scenario: Player completes fourth side of 1x2 box
    Given a grid of size 1x2 with players "foo, bar"
      |  +---+   +  |
      |  Â¦          |
      |  +---+   +  |

    And the players have scores {"foo" = 0, "bar" = 0}
    When a player "bar" joins dots {1,1} and {1,0}
    Then the grid looks like:
      |  +---+   +  |
      |  Â¦barÂ¦      |
      |  +---+   +  |

    And the players have scores {"foo" = 0, "bar" = 1}
    And player "bar" gets another chance

  @todo
  Scenario: Winner is the player with most boxes
    Given a grid of size 1x3 with players "foo, bar"
      |  +---+---+   + |
      |  Â¦fooÂ¦barÂ¦   Â¦ |
      |  +---+---+---+ |

    And the players have scores {"foo" = 1, "bar" = 1}
    When a player "bar" joins dots {0,3} and {0,2}
    Then the grid looks like:
      |  +---+---+---+ |
      |  Â¦fooÂ¦barÂ¦barÂ¦ |
      |  +---+---+---+ |

    And the players have scores {"foo" = 1, "bar" = 2}
    And the game is over
    And the winner is "bar"
